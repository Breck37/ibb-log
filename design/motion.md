# IBB Log Motion System

## Motion Philosophy

Heavy.
Mechanical.
Weighted.
Deliberate.
No bounce.

## Easing

Use cubic-bezier easing similar to:
(0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1)
Slow in, controlled out.

## Signature Logo Intro (600–800ms total)

1. Shaft draws downward (200ms)
2. Plates slide outward from center (200ms)
3. BB fades in (200ms)
4. Red edge glow scans downward once (150ms)

## UI Motion

- Cards rise with slight upward translate + fade.
- Stats count up slowly, not snappy.
- Progress bars fill with slight trailing glow.
- Leaderboard changes flicker very briefly.

## Never

- No spring bounce.
- No elastic effects.
- No playful overshoot.
- No chaotic glow animations.
